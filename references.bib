  abstract        = {The curse of dimensionality associated with the Hilbert space of spin systems provides a significant obstruction to the study of condensed matter systems. Tensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this difficulty in both the numerical and analytic regimes.
                     
                     These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics of a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover: introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information, basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz states.
                     
                     The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are given, with worked solutions in an ancillary file.},

  abstract      = {The rapid development of quantum computing (QC) in the NISQ era urgently
                   demands a low-level benchmark suite and insightful evaluation metrics for
                   characterizing the properties of prototype NISQ devices, the efficiency of QC
                   programming compilers, schedulers and assemblers, and the capability of quantum
                   system simulators in a classical computer. In this work, we fill this gap by
                   proposing a low-level, easy-to-use benchmark suite called QASMBench based on
                   the OpenQASM assembly representation. It consolidates commonly used quantum
                   routines and kernels from a variety of domains including chemistry, simulation,
                   linear algebra, searching, optimization, arithmetic, machine learning, fault
                   tolerance, cryptography, etc., trading-off between generality and usability. To
                   analyze these kernels in terms of NISQ device execution, in addition to circuit
                   width and depth, we propose four circuit metrics including gate density,
                   retention lifespan, measurement density, and entanglement variance, to extract
                   more insights about the execution efficiency, the susceptibility to NISQ error,
                   and the potential gain from machine-specific optimizations. Applications in
                   QASMBench can be launched and verified on several NISQ platforms, including
                   IBM-Q, Rigetti, IonQ and Quantinuum. For evaluation, we measure the execution
                   fidelity of a subset of QASMBench applications on 12 IBM-Q machines through
                   density matrix state tomography, which comprises 25K circuit evaluations. We
                   also compare the fidelity of executions among the IBM-Q machines, the IonQ QPU
                   and the Rigetti Aspen M-1 system. QASMBench is released at:
